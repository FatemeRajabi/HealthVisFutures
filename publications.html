				title: "Designing and Developing a Mobile Application for Monitoring & Visualizing Blood Pressure Data",
				downloadLink: 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253972',
				abstract: 'High blood pressure is one of the major causes of cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, and even sudden death. To avoid developing these health issues, it is important to consistently monitor blood pressure levels. Monitoring blood pressure levels regularly allows people to observe changes in their blood pressure measurements and contact their healthcare providers for guidance if needed. The aim of this paper is designing and developing a mobile application that can assist individuals to better understand the changes in their blood pressure levels by introducing a novel approach to visualizing blood pressure data and managing missing data. Employing a user-centered design approach, we designed and developed an app. To complete this study, we conducted a literature review to identify key design requirements for such apps and then, designed our low-fidelity prototype based on these design requirements. Next, we consulted with two experts to obtain their feedback on the content, presentation, and usability of our initial low-fidelity prototype. Based on these experts feedback we designed our mid-fidelity and high-fidelity prototype. Eventually, we conducted a user evaluation study to evaluate our high-fidelity prototype. The results demonstrated this app provides a clear visual representation of blood pressure measurements over time.',

The main focus of this app is on medication management and adherence with support for other pain management needs such as educational materials and external available resources. The novelty of our work lies in the design and development process of the mHealth app, as we established evidence-based design requirements for our prototype and included older adults and health care professionals in the process.',

				abstract: 'A driving force behind the design of increasingly large and high resolution displays (LHRDs) has been the need to support the explosion of data in the natural sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology. However, our experience with an LHRD accessible to researchers across multiple disciplines has shown that they are useful for a wide range of research activities involving large images and data. \ We conducted in-context, semi-structured interviews with researchers from a variety of disciplines about their experiences using the LHRD with their own data. Notably, it became apparent that the size and resolution of the LHRD supported a multitude of activities related to observation, for which zooming or other enlargement methods on standard resolution screens were not sufficient. The interview findings lead to implications for further research into supporting a broader range of disciplines in using large, high-resolution displays.',

				abstract: 'Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The efficacy of stroke recovery is determined by various factors, including patient adherence to their rehabilitation program. Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial for promoting patients adherence to rehabilitation programs. Aiming to support patient-healthcare provider communication during inpatient stroke rehabilitation, we 1. conducted semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers with expertise in inpatient stroke recovery to extract design requirements for visualizing stroke recovery progress. Using these design requirements, we 2. designed a data visualization tool representing stroke recovery. We 3. sought feedback on the visualization designs from healthcare providers and patients and integrated their feedback into the designs. Informed by the results of our studies, we provided several considerations for designing future visualization tools for patients and providers to communicate during inpatient stroke rehabilitation.',

				abstract: 'This paper is a call to action for research and discussion on data visualization education. As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper—educators and researchers in data visualization—identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: viseducationchallenges.github.io.',

				abstract: 'Non-invasive cardiac radioablation is an emerging therapy for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Electrophysiologic, anatomic and molecular imaging studies are used to localize the breakout region of the VT, but current therapy planning is tedious and prone to error due to a lack of data integration. In this work we present the design and development of a software platform and workflow to facilitate precision-targeted therapy planning, including affine non-rigid multimodality image registration and 2D-3D-4D visualization across modalities. Registration accuracy was measured using Dice Similarity and Hausdorff Distance of total left ventricle tissue volumes, which were 0.914 ± 0.013 and 2.65mm ± 0.34mm, respectively (average ± standard deviation). Electrocardiographic maps of VT parameters were registered temporally to surface electrode data to recreate familiar ECG tracings. 2D polar maps, 3D slice-views, and 4D cine-renderings were used for hybrid fusion displays of molecular and electroanatomic images. Segmentations of the cardiac-gated contrast CT blood-pool and molecular images of perfusion and glucose metabolism were used to identify regions of fibrotic scar tissue and hibernating myocardium in the 3D scene. Ablation targets were painted onto the 2D polar map, 3D slice or 4D-cine views, and exported as DICOM for import to radiotherapy planning software. We anticipate that the combination of accurate multimodality image registration and visualizations will enable more reliable therapy planning, expedite treatment and may improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of these lethal arrhythmias.',

Teaching visualization often involves running learning activities where students perform tasks that directly support one or more topics that the teacher wishes to address in the lesson. As a group of educators and researchers in visualization, we reflect on our learning experiences. Our activities and experiences range from dividing the tasks into smaller parts, considering different learning materials, to encouraging debate. With this paper, our hope is that we can encourage, inspire, and guide other educators with visualization activities.

				abstract: 'Designing patient-collected health data visualizations to support communicating patient data during clinical visits is a challenging problem due to the heterogeneity of the parties involved: patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems. Designers must ensure that all parties’ needs are met. This complexity makes it challenging to find a definitive solution that can work for every individual. We have approached this research problem—communicating patient data during clinical visits—as a wicked problem. In this article, we outline how wicked problem characteristics apply to our research problem. We then describe the research methodologies we employed to explore the design space of individualized patient data visualization solutions. Lastly, we reflect on the insights and experiences we gained through this exploratory design process. We conclude with a call to action for researchers and visualization designers to consider patients’ and healthcare providers’ individualities when designing patient data visualizations.',

				abstract: 'We were approached by a group of healthcare providers who are involved in the care of chronic patients looking for potential technologies to facilitate the process of reviewing patient-generated data during clinical visits. Aiming at understanding the healthcare providers’ attitudes towards reviewing patient-generated data, we (1) conducted a focus group with a mixed group of healthcare providers. Next, to gain the patients’ perspectives, we (2) interviewed eight chronic patients, collected a sample of their data and designed a series of visualizations representing patient data we collected. Last, we (3) sought feedback on the visualization designs from healthcare providers who requested this exploration. We found four factors shaping patient-generated data: data & context, patient’s motivation, patient’s time commitment, and patient’s support circle. Informed by the results of our studies, we discussed the importance of designing patient-generated visualizations for individuals by considering both patient and healthcare provider rather than designing with the purpose of generalization and provided guidelines for designing future patient-generated data visualizations.',

These characteristics make it challenging and time-consuming for providers to understand this data during short clinical visits. We interviewed four diabetes patients and obtained a sample of their data collections to understand their personal lifestyle and perspectives on the process of tracking, recording, and presenting their data.

				abstract: 'Stacked graphs are a visualization technique popular in casual scenarios for representing multiple time-series. Variations of stacked graphs have been focused on reducing the distortion of individual streams because foundational perceptual studies suggest that variably curved slopes may make it difficult to accurately read and compare values. We contribute to this discussion by formally comparing the relative readability of basic stacked area charts, ThemeRivers, streamgraphs and our own interactive technique for straightening baselines of individual streams in a ThemeRiver. We used both real-world and randomly generated datasets and covered tasks at the elementary, intermediate and overall information levels. Results indicate that the decreased distortion of the newer techniques does appear to improve their readability, with streamgraphs performing best for value comparison tasks. We also found that when a variety of tasks is expected to be performed, using the interactive version of the themeriver leads to more correctness at the cost of being slower for value comparison tasks.',

Empowering patients in their own care can facilitate the treatment process, increase patients’ quality of life, and support patients in reaching their goals. A cultural shift towards patient centered care is currently underway, however, at least in Canada, there is still much to be done. Through interviews and focus groups with patients and care providers, we aim to contribute to this cultural shift by identifying three areas of opportunity to involve patients in their own care and be a part of their care team. We then describe potential technology solutions to address these opportunities.',

By combining the results of a literature review from both the HCI and medical literature with the results of clinician interviews explicitly about in-clinic communication issues, we are able to offer a more complete picture of these crucial in-clinic communication challenges. We discuss similarities and subtle but important differences between patients and clinicians perspectives. While patients and clinicians are often talking about the same issue, we found that they differ considerably in opinion and attitude. Drawing upon these subtle yet significant differences and ideas raised by the interviewed clinicians, we offer research suggestions for the design of future in-clinic communication tools.',

				abstract: 'There is a vast amount of unstructured text data generated every day analyzing and making sense of these text-based datasets is a complex, cumbersome task. The existing visualization tools that analyze text data leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, are often tailored for structured text-based data. They also fail to support reading, a crucial analysis task to validate the output of NLP techniques. We designed and developed TextVista, an NLP-enriched visualization tool that supports analysts during their analysis of unstructured text with temporal references. Our tool combines techniques including clustering, sentiment analysis, and threat detection with three views that visualize high-level patterns in the data to encourage reading. We report on TextVistas iterative design process, which included a focus group to distill design requirements, a think-aloud interview study with data analysts to understand their impressions of the tool, and a diary study to assess its long-term usage. Through this process, we identified how TextVista supported the analysis of unstructured text with temporal references using NLP techniques and fostered methods to promote reading in situ. TextVista also encouraged serendipity when analyzing data via its question-focused overviews and flexible avenues to explore data.',
